A **Cal**cium **I**maging Data Analysis **P**ipeline in **R**

calipR is a free and open source software dedicated to calcium imaging data analysis. It is fully coded in R and is distributed as an R package, a standalone windows application, a docker image.


## Key Features

-   No code workflow (Graphical User Interface (GUI))

-   Interactive parameters optimization module

-   Improved Background estimation and signal denoising

    -   Implementation of the Derivative Passing Accumulation method [(Liu & Lin, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-3188-4)

    -   Development of a supervised machine learning classifier

-   Normalization

-   Signal Deconvolution [(Jewell et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxy083) [github](https://github.com/jewellsean/FastLZeroSpikeInference)

-   Basic Statistics

-   > in development Clustering Analysis [(dtwclust package)](https://github.com/asardaes/dtwclust)

-   > in development Peaks metrics analysis (area, kinetics, duration...)


## Project Goals

-   allowing non programmers to **easily** **access** and **use** a semi-automated calcium imaging data analysis pipeline without any programming knowledge/skills.

    -   *Save time*

    -   *Go deeper*
    
    -   *Increase reproducibility*


-   providing R users/developers a **foundation** that can be further **adapted to their specific needs**, taking advantage of R richness in terms of statistical packages and community.


## Important Notes

-   The R package includes a function which starts the same GUI as in the windows application. So MacOS and linux users can benefit from it.

-   To date, calipR doesn't include cell detection. You firstly need to process your video files in Fiji (see tutorial) to detect the cells. calipR takes csv files as input, coming from manual cell detection in Fiji OR automatic cell detection through the trackmate plugin, allowing the use of several segmentation algorithms.

## Option 1 : Windows Application Installation (recommended)

To install the Graphical User Interface (GUI) based version for windows, you only need to download and execute the last version of the calipR.exe file available in the [release section](https://github.com/ETrives/calipR/releases). Once installed, just run the program and start your data analysis!

Note that if you want to interact with the package by coding, there is an embedded R version in the installation folder with all necessary packages + calipR.


## Option 2 : Docker image downloading (recommended for macOS and linux)

For macOS and linux users, the best way to use calipR is from its docker image. The calipr_base image contains all the necessary packages to run calipR + calipR itself. Since it is not installed in your global environment, it will prevent any installation errors.

The very first thing you need is to download docker through : [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

Once Docker is installed, just open the docker desktop application (it needs to be open for the docker commands to work). Then open your command terminal and type the following to download the calipr_base v1.0.0-alpha docker image (or any other available version):

``` bash
docker pull calipr_base:v1.0.0-alpha
```

calipR needs to take inputs from and write outputs into your local machine. In the following command, you need to replace the path with your true absolute path to a folder which contains the folder containing your data (every output generated by calipR like projects created, sql database, banks and results outputs will be written to this destination folder):

``` bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3838:3838 -v c:/replace/by/absolute/path/to/folder/containing/data/:/inst -t calipr_base:v1.0.0-alpha
```

This will open an R session in your command terminal. You then need to load the calipR package:
``` r
library(calipR)
```

To use the graphical user interface type :
``` r
shiny::runApp(guigui(), host = '0.0.0.0', port = 3838)
```

To access the interface, go to :
[http://localhost:3838/](http://localhost:3838/)


## Option 3 : R package Installation

Warning : calipR currently has a lot of dependencies so this option may cause dependency errors while installing (see the troubleshooting section below if it happens). Before trying the following commands, make sure you have the admin rights.

You can download the latest version from r-universe

``` r

install.packages('calipR', repos = c('https://etrives.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

or from github with devtools

``` r
# Install devtools if necessary
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

#load devtools
library(devtools)

#install calipR from github
install_github("ETrives/calipR")
```

if you want to install a specific version

``` r
# Install devtools if necessary
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

#load devtools
library(devtools)

#Install calipR version v1.0.0-alpha
install_github("ETrives/calipR@v1.0.0-alpha")
```

### Troubleshooting option 3 Installation

#### MacOS

##### You lack a software to build packages with compiled code

During calipR installation, a window should open and say you don't have this software and ask you if you want to install it. Say Yes ! it is necessary. After being installed, launch again calipR installation through devtools or r-universe.

if the window doesn't show up or if you want to install it by your self, the software you need is Xcode Command Line Tools. To install it, open your command terminal, type the following and press enter :

``` bash
xcode-select --install
```

##### Installation successfull but GUI not working : X11 library is missing : install xquartz

You may succeed the installation step but encounter this error when trying to use calipR's graphical user interface. On macOS you need to install xquartz from [here](https://www.xquartz.org/) after downloading and installing XQuartz, the application should work correctly.

#### Windows

##### You lack a software to build packages with compiled code

if you use Rstudio, during calipR installation, a window will open and tell you don't have this software and ask you if you want to install it. Say Yes ! it is necessary. After being installed, launch again calipR installation through devtools or r-universe.

if you don't use Rstudio or want to install it by your self, [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is the software you need if you work on a PC. Be careful, you need to install an RTools version which matches your R version. So if you have R 4.3, you should install RTools 4.3

### OS independent :

If you encounter package dependency issues and you want to go for a radical option you can either :

#### update your R packages

``` r
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

#### Delete R and the associated packages and download a fresh R [this might help](https://www.ozturkibrahim.com/how-to-uninstall-r-and-rstudio-with-all-packages-settings-and-everything-else-on-windows/)

``` r
# In your fresh R session install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install calipR from github
install_github("ETrives/calipR")
    
# Or from r-universe
install.packages('calipR', repos = c('https://etrives.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

# Preparing a correct Input for calipR

#### Fluorescence Data

calipR v1.0.0 starts the analysis workflow after the cell detection step. So you first need to do cell detection by yourself and end up with a csv file that can be of two different types :

-   wide format : each column contains the fluorescence values for one cell across a given recording session. The corresponding data frame has the dimensions : frame number\*cell number. This is the output you get if you follow the manual annotation tutorial in ImageJ here.
-   long format : The different cells detected are in lines and identified by a column named TRACK_ID and the corresponding fluorescence values are in another column named MEAN_INTENSITY_CH1. The data frame dimensions are thus (cell number*frame number)*2

#### meta.csv

You need to create a .csv file containing the meta data in two columns, with dimensions (coverslip_number \* stimulus_number)\*2 :

-   stimuli : containing the names of the stimuli your cells were exposed to (e.g. the cells are exposed to vehicle (baseline), glutamate, gaba and kcl. You have 4 stimuli (including baseline) so make sure you have four lines with corresponding names)
-   timing : containing the time (in minutes) at which you started the exposition to the corresponding stimulus (eg. 0, 3, 6, 9 for baseline, glutamate, gaba and kcl means that at 3 minutes post recording glutamate was infused, at 6 minutes = gaba etc.)

The meta data for all animals/groups/coverslips should be placed in one single meta.csv file. calipR takes each fluorescence data file in order. Each new coverslip meta data should be placed in line, below the previous one (eg. if 2 coverslips and 4 stimuli/coverslip, then your file has 8 lines and 2 columns)

#### marker.csv (optional)

This file is optional. It is a .csv file with dimensions 1\*cell number. Each column contains one fluorescence value corresponding to the fluorescent reporter or IHC staining, on the same field of the corresponding recording. This data is used to attribute a molecular identity to recorded cells. You can enter your threshold value in the GUI when loading the data into calipR.

#### Folder Organization

``` bash

├───Folder_Name               # Type the Path to this main folder to load data
│   ├───Group1
│   │   └───Individual1
│   │       └───1.csv         # Fluorescence data -- coverslip 1 Animal 1
│   │       └───2.csv         # Fluorescence data -- coverslip 2 Animal 1
│   │       └───marker1.csv
│   │       └───marker2.csv
│   │   └───Individual2
│   │       └───1.csv
│   │       └───2.csv
│   │       └───marker1.csv
│   │       └───marker2.csv
│   └───meta.csv              # Meta data file with stimulus and timing informations
```
