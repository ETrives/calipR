Description: calipR is a tool to analyze calcium imaging data. It takes csv files
             containing raw fluorescence values for each cell and processes
             this signal to clean, denoise, normalize, deconvolve and extract calcium
             events. It then provides basic descriptive statistics comparing calcium events
             in different experimental conditions. Some clustering options are available
             by interfacing with the dtwclust package.A Graphical User Interface is included
             and allows to run the whole workflow together with visualization options
             to ensure the quality of the analysis.
